How to compile code:
1. gcc --std=gnu99 -o movies Assignment1.c
2. ./movies movie_sample_1.csv

If not in os1:
1. after logging-in type: ssh os1.engr.oregonstate.edu
2. input in onid password
3. now you're in os1! Yay!

Note: When the user chooses option 2 it will not print out all the years
      if you comment out the first void printList and uncomment the second
      void printList, it will print out all the movies with the smallest
      year on top and the biggest year on bottom.
      Everything else should work properly.
